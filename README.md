# Open Fight Stick 3D

The Open Fight Stick 3D (OFS3D) is a 3D printable modular arcade stick designed to be customizable and easy to print. The 3D models print build plate with a build plate of at least 240mm x 200mm. Each component of the OFS3D fits together using a similar concept to a tower joint and do not require traditional metal screws or fasteners. Magnets and concrete can be additionally added to the build to add strength to the joints and weight to the overall design.
