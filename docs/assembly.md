## 3D Printer Requirements

### Must-have

* 200x240mm Print Bed Space
* 0.4mm nozzle

To print the OFS3D Boom Box, you will need a 3D printer capable of printing at least a 200mm x 240mm rectangle. It is recommended to use a 0.6mm nozzle, but a 0.4mm nozzle with PLA is plenty for the case.

### Nice-to-have

* Flexible filament capable such as nylon
* 0.6mm nozzle

You will also need to make sure your printer can handle bridges and your build plate is equipped to properly secure large printed pieces. Some glass plates can be cracked or broken by large, heavy prints.
